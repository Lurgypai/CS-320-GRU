      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"><br>This game follows most standards of American checkers with some adaptations where,<br></p>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
        •Pawns are only able to move diagonally and forward one square.<br><br>
        •After selecting a piece possible positions it can move to will be highlighted on the board.<br><br>
        •To capture a piece you must jump over it (diagonally), multi-jumps are allowed but they must all capture one piece per jump.<br><br>
        •It is not enforced that a player jumps a piece and instead can opt not to, unless they are committing a multi-jump.<br><br>
        •Captured pieces are then removed from the board and game.<br><br>
        •Once a piece reaches the other side of the board it becomes a King.<br><br>
        •King pieces follow the same rules however they are allowed to move to squares that are diagonally backwards and jump backwards.<br><br>
        •To win you must capture all enemy pieces or prohibit the other player from being able to move any of their pieces.<br><br></p>
