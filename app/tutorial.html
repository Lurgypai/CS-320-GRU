    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"><br>This game follows most standards of American checkers where,<br></p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">
      •Pawns are only able to move diagonally and forward one square.<br><br>
      •To capture a piece you must jump over it (diagonally), multi-jumps are allowed but they must all capture one piece per jump.<br><br>
      •It is not enforced that a player jumps a piece and instead can opt not to, unless they are committing a multi-jump.<br><br>
      •Captured pieces are then removed from the board and game.<br><br>
      •Once a piece reaches the other side of the board it becomes a King.<br><br>
      •King pieces follow the same rules however they are allowed to move to squares that are diagonally backwards and jump backwards.<br><br>
      •To win you must capture all enemy pieces or prohibit the other player from being able to move any of their pieces.<br><br></p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">To start playing,</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large">
      •Choose the game option you wish to play, by choosing to either host or join a game.<br><br>
      •If you are hosting wait until the other player joins, if you are joining then you will need to enter the username of the person hosting.<br><br>
      •Once they connect this should transport you to the game page where the board will be displayed, Black will always move first.<br><br>
      •After completing a game the menu at the top will allow players to reset the game to play again or cancel the game.<br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">When you are ready to play return with the button below!</p>
