Here's hoping we didn't bite off more than we can chew.

The SRS document is a starting point for understanding the project and its intentions. It features information regarding an overall description of the project, the project's contextual items, and the requirements (functional and non-functional).   

The Software design document is useful in providing a visual aspect of our software. This is done by providing the Activity, Class and Behavioral diagrams to demonstrate how our software will be structured and used. We are currently in the designing and modeling phase of our project after finishing the Software design document.
