Here's hoping we didn't bite off more than we can chew.

The SRS document is a starting point for understanding the project and its intentions. It features information regarding an overall description of the project, the project's contextual items, and the requirements (functional and non-functional).   

After constructing the SRS document we have progressed onto creating the Software Design Document. This is to provide Activity, Class and Behavioral diagrams to demonstrate how our software will be structured.
